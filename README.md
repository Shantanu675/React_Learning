# React Practice Projects ⚛️

- This repository includes my hands-on learning with **React.js**.  
- I practice core concepts like components, props, state, hooks, and routing.  
- Small React projects are added to apply what I learn practically.  
- The goal is to build a strong foundation in frontend development. 🎯
